I made a code to search through each a csv and an excel sheet because we had to give certificates to people who had attended our DSA bootcamp. This worked for the most part but it can have some changes to it such as better optimization of the search.

Problem Statement for this code: I had to search through two sets of data which I am lazyy to do so i felt it would be a better use of my time if I used a code to get the end result. 
I used fuzzywuzy to get the similar names. Weird name for a module I know.
